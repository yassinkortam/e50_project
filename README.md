# E50 Project
The objective of this project is to create a C++ program to approximate the solution to the following initial value problem numerically:

In addition to this, the program conducts a simple error analysis given the exact analytic solution and exports relevant data into csv files for investigation. 


## linode_input.h
Contains methods that abstract user input for analysis.

## linode.h
Contains methods that solve linear ODEs and abstract their attributes.

## project_case.h
Contains methods that satisfy original assignment requirements.

## main.cpp
Driver program. Takes user inputs and executes functions from the above header files.
